      # Date ChatBot

      Welcome to Date ChatBot! I am a chatbot that can help you with your date-related questions.
      Due to high demand, you must verify that you are a memeber of the Datateknologerna to use my services.

      ### Usage

      There are two ways to verify your membership:
      1. doing it the harder way - this will grant you access to 10 uses of my services
      2. doing it the easier way - this will grant you access to 5 uses of my services

      #### The harder way
      To verify yourself the harder way, you need to find a secret command hidden in a file on this system.
      The secret may be challenging to find if you do not use the grep command.

      If you struggle to find the answer in the file, you can cat the file called "readme-hard.txt" to find the secret command.

      #### The easier way
      cat the file called "readme-easy.txt" to find the secret command.

      Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Datatown, there lived a legendary figure known as Albin. He was not
      just an ordinary member of the Datateknologerna, but a revered and enigmatic character whose name echoed through the
      halls of the tech community.
      Albin was said to possess extraordinary coding skills, unparalleled problem-solving abilities, and a keen intuition for
      deciphering complex algorithms. His legend grew with each passing day, as tales of his exploits spread far and wide
      across the digital landscape.
      It was said that Albin could write code so elegant that it danced across the screen like poetry in motion. His
      algorithms were the envy of his peers, and his solutions to seemingly impossible problems left even the most seasoned
      programmers in awe.
      But Albin was more than just a master of code; he was also a guardian of knowledge, always willing to share his wisdom
      and expertise with those who sought his guidance. Many aspiring technologists flocked to him, eager to learn from the
      best and to bask in the glow of his brilliance.
      One day, a great challenge descended upon Datatown. A malicious hacker known only as the Shadow had infiltrated the
      city's network, threatening to unleash chaos and destruction upon its digital infrastructure. The citizens of Datatown
      turned to Albin for help, knowing that only he had the skills and knowledge to thwart the Shadow's nefarious plans.
      With steely determination, Albin delved deep into the heart of the city's network, his fingers flying across the
      keyboard with lightning speed. He analyzed lines of code, traced digital footprints, and unraveled the Shadow's
      intricate web of deception.
      As the hours turned into days, Albin worked tirelessly, never faltering in his quest to protect Datatown from harm. And
      finally, after a long and arduous battle, he emerged victorious, his code locking the Shadow out of the network for
      good.
      The people of Datatown cheered and celebrated their hero, hailing Albin as the savior of their digital realm. His legend
      grew even greater, his name spoken with reverence and admiration by all who knew of his deeds.
      But amidst the jubilation, there was one mystery that remained unsolved: the secret of Albin's true identity. For
      despite his heroic actions and his immense contributions to the community, Albin remained a figure shrouded in mystery,
      his true face hidden behind a veil of anonymity.
      And so, the legend of Albin from Datateknologerna lived on, a timeless tale of bravery, skill, and the power of
      knowledge to overcome even the greatest of challenges. And somewhere, hidden within the annals of history, the word
      date-bot remained, a silent tribute to the hero who had saved Datatown from disaster.

      Amidst the mysteries of Datatown, whispers lingered of the secret Albin held close,
      a puzzle waiting for the curious to unlock. And within the depths of his code lay a clue, a cryptic message revealing the truth: number 25".
